    "3) Determine distribution of test statistic and compute a $p$-value. If you have taken inferential statistics before, you likely computed a $z$ or $t$ statistic and used a calculator or table to compute a $p$-value. This is based on asymptotic theory of sample means/proportions. This is not the approach taken in Data8.2x. With better computing power, we can use simulation to obtain an empirical distribution of our test statistic under the null hypothesis. \n",

    "4) Conclude. For low $p$-value (generally below 0.05), we reject the null hypothesis. For high $p$-value, we fail to reject. Low $p$-value implies that our sample would be very unusual if the null hypothesis were actually true. Therefore, that is evidence that the null hypothesis is wrong. "
